    "# Data Preparation for Video Recommender\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few steps which were performed to prepare the data directly in a Jupyter notebook. These included removing empty rows, removing the customers who rated less than 5 movies, and removing videos which had less than 10 reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section this pre-processing is doen using Amazon Athena instead. Athena is built using Presto and allows the user to run sql queries directly on data stored in s3 and more. This allows joining tables, and processing the data so it is in a form to be used by the algorithm. This allows easy processing of large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a real business example data will we sourced from a large variety of various tables and databases. It is also likely that each of these sources will contain much more data than can fit in memory directly. This is where Athena can be very useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are alternative approaches to achieve this such as processing files in chunks, using Hadoop or Spark, or accessing data from a datawarehouse such as Redshift. Athena has the advantage that it is very simple and cheap while covering a large number of use cases.\n"
