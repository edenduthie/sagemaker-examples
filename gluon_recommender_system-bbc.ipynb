    "\n",
    "In many ways, recommender systems were a catalyst for the current popularity of machine learning.  One of Amazon's earliest successes was the \"Customers who bought this, also bought...\" feature, while the million dollar Netflix Prize spurred research, raised public awareness, and inspired numerous other data science competitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommender systems can utilize a multitude of data sources and ML algorithms, and most combine various unsupervised, supervised, and reinforcement learning techniques into a holistic framework.  However, the core component is almost always a model which which predicts a user's rating (or purchase) for a certain item based on that user's historical ratings of similar items as well as the behavior of other similar users.  The minimal required dataset for this is a history of user item ratings.  In our case, we'll use 1 to 5 star ratings from over 2M Amazon customers on over 160K digital videos.  More details on this dataset can be found at its [AWS Public Datasets page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/readme.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix factorization has been the cornerstone of most user-item prediction models.  This method starts with the large, sparse, user-item ratings in a single matrix, where users index the rows, and items index the columns.  It then seeks to find two lower-dimensional, dense matrices which, when multiplied together, preserve the information and relationships in the larger matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://data-artisans.com/img/blog/factorization.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix factorization has been extended and genarlized with deep learning and embeddings.  These techniques allows us to introduce non-linearities for enhanced performance and flexibility.  This notebook will fit a neural network-based model to generate recommendations for the Amazon video dataset.  It will start by exploring our data in the notebook and even training a model on a sample of the data.  Later we'll expand to the full dataset and fit our model using a SageMaker managed training cluster.  We'll then deploy to an endpoint and check our method.\n",

    "- The IAM role arn used to give training and hosting access to your data. See the documentation for how to create these.

    "Now, we can create an MXNet estimator from the SageMaker Python SDK.  To do so, we need to pass in:\n",
    "1. Instance type and count for our SageMaker Training cluster.  SageMaker's MXNet containers support distributed GPU training, so we could easily set this to multiple ml.p2 or ml.p3 instances if we wanted.\n",
    "  - *Note, this would require some changes to our recommender.py script as we would need to setup the context an key value store properly, as well as determining if and how to distribute the training data.*\n",
    "1. An S3 path for out model artifacts and a role with access to S3 input and output paths.\n",
    "1. Hyperparameters for our neural network.  Since with a 64 dimensional embedding, our recommendations reverted too closely to the mean, let's increase this by an order of magnitude when we train outside of our local instance.  We'll also increase the epochs to see how our accuracy evolves over time. We'll leave all other hyperparameters the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we use `.fit()` this creates a SageMaker Training Job that spins up instances, loads the appropriate packages and data, runs our `train` function from `recommender.py`, wraps up and saves model artifacts to S3, and finishes by tearing down the cluster."

    "- hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "- controlling for overfitting (early stopping, dropout, etc.)\n",
    "- testing whether binarizing our target variable would improve results\n",
    "- including other information sources (video genres, historical ratings, time of review)\n",
    "- adjusting our threshold for user and item inclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to improving the model, we could improve the engineering by:\n",
    "- Setting the context and key value store up for distributed training\n",
    "- Fine tuning our data ingestion (e.g. num_workers on our data iterators) to ensure we're fully utilizing our GPU\n",
    "- Thinking about how pre-processing would need to change as datasets scale beyond a single machine\n",
